# Changes For Code Review

## Plan
 - Use XUnit to drive the code testing
    - mock out the service, infrastructure lay, and use basic SOLID principals to guide TDD.
    - Enable development before the data layer is contructed to provide development time while not in the environment

- follow requirements as needed
